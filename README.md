## Introduction

The notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the Zomato dataset, offering insights into factors that influence restaurant ratings and success. It also includes a classification model to predict whether a restaurant will be successful based on various features.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and includes information about restaurants, such as location, cuisine, ratings, and more. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data).

## Analysis

In the analysis section of the notebook, you will find:

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Correlation analysis to identify key factors affecting restaurant ratings.
- Insights into popular cuisines, locations, and more.

## Classification

The classification section of the notebook covers:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Building a machine learning classification model.
- Evaluating model performance.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, you will need Python and the following libraries:
